postzegel-20-jaar-linux
=======================

Dutch stamp commemorating 20 years of Linux

The scalable design was made in Inkscape and stored in drawing.svg. The export of it is stored in drawing.png. This was used to order the stamps at https://persoonlijkepostzegel.postnl.nl/ for the Dutch postal system. A screenshot of the resulting order is stored in screenshot-ordering.png. For usage in the Belgium postal system, a redesign in terms of dimension has to be made before ordering at https://mystamp.bpost.be/
